				<h2 class="center">Hi üëã</h2>
				<h5 class="center">I'm trying to revolutionize patient experience through food.</h5>
				<div class="spacing"></div>
				<p>My name is Brenna Sorkin, I'm a senior at Northeastern University, studying Computer Science and Interaction Design with a focus in Healthcare & Accessibility and I have the extreme pleasure of working at Boston Children's Hospital as a User Experience Designer. <a href="https://www.brennasorkin.com/index.html" target="_blank">Check out my website!</a></p>
				<p> I've been passionate about healthcare experience since I chopped off a finger on my dominant hand (not while cooking!) when I was 16. Thankfully, healthcare is finally coming to the realization that it's not enough to just keep people alive - we need to make sure they have as positive an experience as possible. Food is a huge part of that.</p>
				<p>Here's a high level view of what I'm conceptualizing: </p>

				<div class="jumbotron">
					<p class="lead">1. A pop-up restaurant within a hospital that is communal and accessible </p>
					<hr class="my-4">
					<p class="lead">2. A series of interactive experiences (events, classes, etc.) for children in the hospital that are enjoyable and promote positive relationships with cooking and food</p></p>

				<h5 class="center">Let me tell you what this project is all about...</h5>
				<div class="spacing"></div>
				<p>
					It is well established that patient experience is directly tied to health outcomes and recovery (Doyle, Lennox and Bell, 2013). Research has also shown that, <span class="highlight">particularly for children, the hospital experience can be so traumatizing that it damages the well-being of the child</span> (Salmela, Aronen and Salanter√§, 2010). While there are endless facets of the patient experience that could be improved, the focus of this project is an innovative and patient-focused food experience within a children‚Äôs hospital. Though patients come from a range of different family situations, in general, the transition away from family meals is a major adjustment and contributes greatly to the lack of a sense of normalcy in the hospital. Hospitalized children are already missing out on other developmental opportunities such as school and peer interaction and, since <span class="highlight">research has shown that frequent family meals lead to better lifelong outcomes for children</span> (Fulkerson et al., 2006), a positive food experience could give them a developmental opportunity back. The current options for food experiences in the hospital are limited to in-room meals, overcrowded and repetitive cafeterias, and chain eateries. <span class="highlight">I am proposing an alternative that will provide patients and families with an experience that transports them emotionally outside of the hospital</span> and allows them to have a positive experience without compromising the care of the child or having to be far away from them.</p>
					<p>
						This project is an  exploration into how the hospital experience could be improved for a number of stakeholders and users. Some of the potential users of this food experience include:
						<ul>
							<li>
								<span class="highlight">Parents of a hospitalized child</span> - having a sick child has been shown to put strain on marriages (Joesch and Smith, 1997), and parents could use the space as a date spot without being far from their child.</li>
								<li>
									<span class="highlight">Families (including the sick child)</span> where the child must live in the hospital for an extended period of time -  these children are in a variety of circumstances; they often have strict dietary restrictions or feeding tubes and the child may also be confined to a wheelchair or even a hospital bed, all of which would need to be accounted for in the experience.</li>
									<li>
										<span class="highlight">Families passing through the hospital</span> for follow-ups or outpatient procedures - these families may be here for a limited time, but may be experiencing more acute stress as the experience is out of the norm of them.</li>
									</ul>


								</p>
								<p>
									I also want to include some sort of interactive component (inspired somewhat by the <a href="http://www.childrenshospital.org/patient-resources/family-resources/creative-arts-program/seacrest-studios">Seacrest Studios</a>) that <span class="highlight">allows patients to engage with food or food systems in an interactive and inspiring way.</span> There are many considerations in these concepts, including food safety, dietary restrictions, and participation of patients with different ambulatory needs and those who use feeding tubes instead of ingesting solid food.
								</p>
								<p>
									For this project, I am developing the brand for this experience and describing in detail how it would function. The final results will live on this site and also be compiled into a polished paper.
