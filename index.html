				<h2 class="center">Hi üëã</h2>
				<h5 class="center">I'm trying to revolutionize patient experience through food.</h5>
				<div class="spacing"></div>
				<p>My name is Brenna Sorkin, I'm a senior at Northeastern University, studying Computer Science and Interaction Design with a focus in Healthcare & Accessibility and I have the extreme pleasure of working at Boston Children's Hospital as a User Experience Designer. <a href="https://www.brennasorkin.com/index.html" target="_blank">Check out my website!</a></p>
				<p> I've been passionate about healthcare experience since I chopped off a finger on my dominant hand (not while cooking!) when I was 16. Thankfully, healthcare is finally coming to the realization that it's not enough to just keep people alive - we need to make sure they have as positive an experience as possible. Food is a huge part of that.</p>
				<p>Here's a high level view of what I'm conceptualizing: </p>

				<div class="jumbotron">
					<p class="lead">1. A pop-up restaurant within a hospital that is communal and accessible </p>
					<hr class="my-4">
					<p class="lead">2. A series of interactive experiences (events, classes, etc.) for children in the hospital that are enjoyable and promote positive relationships with cooking and food</p></p>

				<h2 class="center">Project Details üõ†Ô∏è</h2>
				<h5 class="center">Let me tell you what this project is all about...</h5>
				<div class="spacing"></div>
				<p>
					It is well established that patient experience is directly tied to health outcomes and recovery (Doyle, Lennox and Bell, 2013). Research has also shown that, <span class="highlight">particularly for children, the hospital experience can be so traumatizing that it damages the well-being of the child</span> (Salmela, Aronen and Salanter√§, 2010). While there are endless facets of the patient experience that could be improved, the focus of this project is an innovative and patient-focused food experience within a children‚Äôs hospital. Though patients come from a range of different family situations, in general, the transition away from family meals is a major adjustment and contributes greatly to the lack of a sense of normalcy in the hospital. Hospitalized children are already missing out on other developmental opportunities such as school and peer interaction and, since <span class="highlight">research has shown that frequent family meals lead to better lifelong outcomes for children</span> (Fulkerson et al., 2006), a positive food experience could give them a developmental opportunity back. The current options for food experiences in the hospital are limited to in-room meals, overcrowded and repetitive cafeterias, and chain eateries. <span class="highlight">I am proposing an alternative that will provide patients and families with an experience that transports them emotionally outside of the hospital</span> and allows them to have a positive experience without compromising the care of the child or having to be far away from them.</p>
					<p>
						This project is an  exploration into how the hospital experience could be improved for a number of stakeholders and users. Some of the potential users of this food experience include:
						<ul>
							<li>
								<span class="highlight">Parents of a hospitalized child</span> - having a sick child has been shown to put strain on marriages (Joesch and Smith, 1997), and parents could use the space as a date spot without being far from their child.</li>
								<li>
									<span class="highlight">Families (including the sick child)</span> where the child must live in the hospital for an extended period of time -  these children are in a variety of circumstances; they often have strict dietary restrictions or feeding tubes and the child may also be confined to a wheelchair or even a hospital bed, all of which would need to be accounted for in the experience.</li>
									<li>
										<span class="highlight">Families passing through the hospital</span> for follow-ups or outpatient procedures - these families may be here for a limited time, but may be experiencing more acute stress as the experience is out of the norm of them.</li>
									</ul>


								</p>
								<p>
									I also want to include some sort of interactive component (inspired somewhat by the <a href="http://www.childrenshospital.org/patient-resources/family-resources/creative-arts-program/seacrest-studios">Seacrest Studios</a>) that <span class="highlight">allows patients to engage with food or food systems in an interactive and inspiring way.</span> There are many considerations in these concepts, including food safety, dietary restrictions, and participation of patients with different ambulatory needs and those who use feeding tubes instead of ingesting solid food.
								</p>
								<p>
									For this project, I am developing the brand for this experience and describing in detail how it would function. The final results will live on this site and also be compiled into a polished paper.

								<div class="small-spacing"></div>
								<p>My intention for this brand is for it to strike a balance between adult vs. child and playful vs. sophisticated. I want the brand to reflect the values of locally sourced ingredients and sustainablility, while still being accessible to children. For these first drafts, I used icons from <a href="https://www.flaticon.com/home">flaticon.com</a>, as a proof of concept - for the final logo I will sketch by hand - but I added the color in a way that reflects somewhat of a "coloring book" feel.</p>

								<h2 class="center">Layout Exploration üèóÔ∏è</h2>
								<h5 class="center">Initial thoughts on how the space could be arranged</h5>
								<div class="spacing"></div>

								<div class="row">

									<div class="col-md-6">
								<div class="small-spacing"></div>

										<h5 class="hd">Lights, Camera, Eat.</h5>
										<p>The kitchen, placed at the center of the room, is also the lowest point, allowing all diners to see what‚Äôs happening in the kitchen.  The dining space is broken into levels, with a stair and a ramp allowing access between each. I envision there being two types of nights: (1) regular evenings where one can watch what‚Äôs happening in the kitchen throughout, (2) show evenings, where - with the kitchen in the center - the creation of food is put on as an event. This could be a cooking demonstration, a competition, or just a meal put together with flare. </p>
									</div>
									<div class="col-md-6">
								<div class="small-spacing"></div>

										<h5 class="hd">A Culture of Accomodation</h5>
										<p>Many of the children who will be eating in this space require accommodation in order to enjoy a meal. Whether it be food allergies, nutritional supplements, or pureed food, these kids are used to feeling uncomfortable as they ask for changes to be made. In this space, the kitchen will be prepared for these requests, even anticipating them through reservations when possible, and accommodation will be the norm. No child will be made to feel an outlier for their dietary needs, as the diner will be put at the center of the experience.</p>
									</div>
								</div>

								
								
								<img src="layout2.png" alt="sketch of the layout of the space, with the kitchen in the center with levels of tables surrounding it." class="img-fluid">
								<div class="spacing"></div>
								
								<div class="row">

									<div class="col-md-6">
										<div class="small-spacing"></div>

										<h6 class="hd">(1) Drinks Bar</h6>
										<p>A traditional-style bar, but with non-alcoholic drinks as the default. Sophisticated enough in styling and execution to be an exciting experience for the children, as opposed to a cliche (think Rainforest Cafe). The experience should engage kids in the exciting aspects of having a drink made - the shaking, stirring, choosing the ingredients. The bar is a fish tank.</p>
										<img class="img-fluid" alt="(left) a trendy bartender, wearing a denim apron with leather straps. (right) a large fishtank" src="layout/bartender_fish.png">
										<div class="small-spacing"></div>

									</div>
									<div class="col-md-6">
										<div class="small-spacing"></div>

										<h6 class="hd">(2) Food Bar</h6>
										<p>Whether it be sushi, fruits carvings, or intricate plating, this bar provides some sort of food based experience that is visually exciting. This bar should provide variety and visual engagement, potentially even letting the children participate (adding a decoration to a plate, etc.). The Bar is a George Rhoads-style kinetic sculpture, set within a terrarium.</p>
										<img class="img-fluid" alt="(left) a large terrarium of moss and branches. (right) A George Rhoads kinetic sclupture" src="layout/sculpture_terr.png">
										<div class="small-spacing"></div>

									</div>
								</div>

								<div class="row">

									<div class="col-md-6">
										<div class="spacing"></div>

										<h6 class="hd">(3) Small Tables</h6>
										<p>There are a number of small tables throughout the space, of varying sizes, that can accommodate 2 - 6 people. On show nights, tables will have fewer seats so that patrons can face towards the kitchen. These tables are intended to be reserved ahead of time, or for walk in parties. They can easily accommodate wheelchairs.</p>
									</div>
									<div class="col-md-6">
										<div class="spacing"></div>

										<h6 class="hd">(4) Community Tables</h6>
										<p>In the space, there will be long, modular, community tables. The purpose of these tables is for anyone to join - whether it be parties looking to socialize, or individuals, these tables are a shared space for all. The tables can come apart into sections and can also be adjusted by height. Outside of food service, the tables can be used for cooking demonstrations.</p>
